yarn add axios

Set a different key to create new modal components instances,
so it invokes constructor with new props.
In Add modal, re-create the modal every time is opened. As employee prop is not provided,
constructor is called and default state is applied.
In Edit modal, re-create the modal every time a new employee is passed as prop,
so it calls constructor with new employee prop every time.
